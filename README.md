# Online Job Notifier

This frontend application is designed to collect user input, conduct thorough analysis, and send weekly updates. The semi-automated system performs repetitive tasks based on user inputs, 
utilizing a notifier and periodic scheduling to alert users when job applications are available at specified intervals. Given its personalized nature, the frequency of user visits is minimal.

Users can specify their preferred job type and location. The application then scrapes data from job portals, transforms it into structured data, and sends this information to users via Gmail. 
This process repeats continuously at set intervals. The use of tools that automatically detect updates and select relevant information is crucial in today's environment. Web scraping facilitates 
this by extracting and structuring data from web pages.

Web scraping is a technique for extracting data from websites and converting unstructured web data (such as HTML formats) into structured data that can be stored locally or in a database. 
This application finds new job openings on job portals and alerts users with the required information, significantly reducing the manual effort of visiting websites and searching for new jobs multiple times. 
By collecting data from job portals and sending it to users, the application streamlines the job search process.

The user interface will open in the browser, allowing users to input their details, including email, preferred location, and job role based on their skills.
In this project, notifications are scheduled weekly, and users can set their preferred time for receiving notifications.

After submitting the details, users will be redirected to a confirmation page indicating that their information has been recorded.
The backend terminal will display the inputs provided by the user, job vacancy information, and confirmation that the notification email has been sent to the user.
